# Pencil Sketch Maker

A sleek, futuristic, single-file web application that instantly transforms any uploaded image into a realistic pencil sketch using pure HTML5 Canvas and CSS filters—no frameworks, no backend, no external libraries.

---

## Features

- **Instant Pencil Sketch Effect**: Utilises advanced Canvas compositing (`color-dodge`) with grayscale conversion, inversion, and Gaussian blur to create authentic dark pencil lines on a light paper-like background.
- **Futuristic Cyberpunk UI**: Glassmorphism cards, neon glows, animated gradients, hover effects, and sci-fi typography powered purely by CSS.
- **Fully Client-Side**: Everything runs in the browser—zero server processing, no data upload, complete privacy.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimised for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **One-Click Download**: Save the generated sketch as a high-quality PNG.
- **Clean File Upload**: Custom neon-styled button with no visible default browser file input elements.
- **Favicon Support**: Neon pencil icon displayed in browser tabs.

## How It Works

1. Click **"Choose Image"** and upload any photo (JPG, PNG, etc.).
2. The app automatically resizes the image (max width 800px) for optimal performance.
3. The pencil sketch is generated instantly using:
   - Grayscale base layer
   - Inverted + blurred overlay with `color-dodge` blending
   - Light paper background
4. Compare side-by-side with the original.
5. Download the sketch or reset to start over.
